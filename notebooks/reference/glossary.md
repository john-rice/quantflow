## Moneyness

Monenyness is used in the context of option pricing and it is defined as

\begin{equation}
    \ln\frac{K}{F}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is the strike and $F$ is the Forward price. A positive value implies strikes above the forward, which means put options are in the money and call options are out of the money.
